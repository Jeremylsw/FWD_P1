                        Embark on a water sightseeing bus tour running between the Sumida River and Odaiba
                        with a total of 8 stops along the way. This Mirai sightseeing ship was specially designed by
                        Japanese animation master Reiji Matsumoto. It has a cool appearance and looks like a teardrop
                        and the ehtire hull is covered with a glass roof. Enjoy the breathtaking scenery of Tokyo on both
                        sides of the strait while sitting in this stunning ship.

                        Visit the Meiji Jingu - a Shinto shrine dedicated to the Emperor Meiji and 
                        his wife, Empress Shoken. It is located in Tokyo’s Shibuya ward. The shrine is surrounded 
                        by a forest park consisting of over 120,000 trees donated by people from all parts of Japan. 
                        Together with the adjacent Yoyogi Park, Meiji Jingu is part of a large greenspace in central Tokyo. 
                        Enormous torii, or gates, mark the entrance to the shrine complex. Because of its size and the relative 
                        seclusion it offers, Meiji Jingu is an extremely popular location.

                        Located in a western portion of Tokyo, the Ghibli Museum is dedicated 
                        to showcasing the work of the Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli. 
                        Designed by Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki, the museum is heavily
                         influenced by European architectural styles. Miyazaki used film storyboards 
                         to sketch out a plan inspired by locations such as the hilltop village of 
                         Calcata in Italy. Full of everything related to Ghibli animations, visitors
                          can not only take a look at the animation buildings, they can also see 
                          original Ghibli works and other animation materials. The museum’s souvenir 
                          shop and themed restaurant are also very popular.
